Fix TS extensions

Because after compiling from TypeScript JavaScript files miss '.js' extensions in import statements `extensions.js` file was made. Script depends on `filehound` module.

To simplify compiling process VS Code task (`.vscode/tasks.json`) was made which runs TS build, installs all node dependencies and runs `extensions` script.
